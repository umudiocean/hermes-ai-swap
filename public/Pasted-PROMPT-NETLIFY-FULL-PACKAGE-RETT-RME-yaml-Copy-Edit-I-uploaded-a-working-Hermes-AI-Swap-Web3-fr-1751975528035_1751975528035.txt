PROMPT: NETLIFY FULL PACKAGE ÜRETTİRME 🔮
yaml
Copy
Edit
I uploaded a working Hermes AI Swap Web3 frontend.  
Now I want you to rebuild and deliver a **clean, deploy-ready ZIP file optimized for Netlify**.

---

✅ GOAL:
- Final zip should be 100% compatible with Netlify
- Must build without errors (`npm run build`)
- No missing source files (`src/`, `index.html`, etc.)
- Final output: clean `.zip` or `.tar.gz` I can directly upload to Netlify

---

🔧 WHAT TO INCLUDE:

📁 REQUIRED STRUCTURE:
- `index.html` at root
- `src/` folder with all React + TS files
- `public/` with logos, icons, manifest
- `vite.config.ts` with Netlify-compatible `outDir: "dist"`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- `netlify.toml` (see below)

---

⚙️ CONFIG FILES TO APPLY:

📦 `vite.config.ts`
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import path from "path"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "src"),
    }
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "dist",
    sourcemap: false,
    minify: "esbuild"
  },
  define: {
    global: "globalThis"
  }
})
📦 netlify.toml

🧪 TEST GOALS BEFORE DELIVERY:

npm install && npm run build works locally

dist/ folder generated with valid index.html

Vite aliases (@/) work properly

No missing files in src/ (App.tsx, main.tsx, etc.)

📦 FINAL OUTPUT:

Give me a final .zip or .tar.gz of the frontend

It must deploy on Netlify without any config edits

All files must be production-ready

Build a clean, complete frontend project based on the uploaded version — but optimize and verify it for Netlify, not Vercel.
